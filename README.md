LESS fiddle script/page

NOTE: there is a minor issue with the CodeMirror editor, where typing an ampersand in certain 
cases causes the editor to become unresponsive. You may work around this by undoing the typing of the
ampersand and copy another rule that already has an ampersand.

You can try it out here (note: uses rawgithub): http://kzantow.github.io/fiddle-less

And here is a Powerpoint presentation I gave about LESS: http://kzantow.github.io/fiddle-less/Using%20LESS%20for%20better%20HTML.ppt
